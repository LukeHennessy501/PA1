                "Karl Heinrich Marx FRSA (German: [maʁks]; 5 May 1818 – 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher,
                economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist, critic of political economy, and
                socialist revolutionary. His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the
                four-volume Das Kapital (1867–1883). Marx's political and philosophical thought had enormous
                influence on subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history. His name has been used as an
                adjective, a noun, and a school of social theory."

                "Born in Trier, Germany, Marx studied law and philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. He
                married German theatre critic and political activist Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Due to his
                political publications, Marx became stateless and lived in exile with his wife and children in
                London for decades, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German
                philosopher Friedrich Engels and publish his writings, researching in the British Museum Reading
                Room."

                "Marx's critical theories about society, economics, and politics, collectively understood as Marxism,
                hold that human societies develop through class conflict. In the capitalist mode of production, this
                manifests itself in the conflict between the ruling classes (known as the bourgeoisie) that control
                the means of production and the working classes (known as the proletariat) that enable these means
                by selling their labour-power in return for wages.Employing a critical approach known as
                historical materialism, Marx predicted that capitalism produced internal tensions like previous
                socioeconomic systems and that these tensions would lead to its self-destruction and replacement by
                a new system known as the socialist mode of production. For Marx, class antagonisms under
                capitalism—owing in part to its instability and crisis-prone nature—would eventuate the working
                class's development of class consciousness, leading to their conquest of political power and
                eventually the establishment of a classless, communist society constituted by a free association of
                producers.Marx actively pressed for its implementation, arguing that the working class should
                carry out organised proletarian revolutionary action to topple capitalism and bring about
                socio-economic emancipation."
