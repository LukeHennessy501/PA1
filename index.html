                Karl Marx has written many works that touch on a vast variety of subjects. You can find contributions to
                the fields of philosophy and social thought, economics, history, sociology, international relations.
            </P>
            <p>
                Many people today use his name in a negative context due to social conditioning and fear around
                communism in general (Communism is what he is most known for among the general public) but he also was
                instrumental in the creation of social science.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this website is not only to educate people about Karl Marx but also to hopefully undue some
                of the stigma around this important historical and scientific figure.
