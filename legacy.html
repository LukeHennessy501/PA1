                "Marx's ideas have had a profound impact on world politics and intellectual thought, in particular
                in
                the aftermath of the 1917 Russian Revolution. Followers of Marx have often
                debated among themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern
                world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of
                which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies
                include political theories such as Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism, and
                libertarian Marxism and Open Marxism, Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism,
                often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical materialism,
                phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism, and Hegelian Marxism."

                "From an academic perspective, Marx's work contributed to the birth of modern sociology. He has been
                cited as one of the 19th century's three masters of the "school of suspicion", alongside Friedrich
                Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud,and as one of the three principal architects of modern social
                science along with Émile Durkheim and Max Weber.In contrast to other philosophers, Marx
                offered theories that could often be tested with the scientific method.Both Marx and Auguste
                Comte set out to develop scientifically justified ideologies in the wake of European secularisation
                and new developments in the philosophies of history and science. Working in the Hegelian tradition,
                Marx rejected Comtean sociological positivism in an attempt to develop a science of society.
                Karl Löwith considered Marx and Søren Kierkegaard to be the two greatest Hegelian philosophical
                successors.In modern sociological theory, Marxist sociology is recognised as one of the main
                classical perspectives. Isaiah Berlin considers Marx the true founder of modern sociology "in so far
                as anyone can claim the title".Beyond social science, he has also had a lasting legacy in
                philosophy, literature, the arts and the humanities."

                "Politically, Marx's legacy is more complex. Throughout the 20th century, revolutions in dozens of
                countries labelled themselves "Marxist"—most notably the Russian Revolution, which led to the
                founding of the Soviet Union.Major world leaders including Vladimir Lenin,Mao
                Zedong,Fidel Castro,Salvador Allende,Josip Broz Tito,Kwame Nkrumah,
                Jawaharlal Nehru,Nelson Mandela,Xi Jinping,Jean-Claude Juncker,and
                Thomas Sankara have all cited Marx as an influence. Beyond where Marxist revolutions took
                place, Marx's ideas have informed political parties worldwide.In countries associated with
                Marxism, some events have led political opponents to blame Marx for millions of deaths,while
                others argue for a distinction between the legacy and influence of Marx specifically, and the legacy
                and influence of those who have shaped his ideas for political purposes.Arthur Lipow describes
                Marx and his collaborator Friedrich Engels as "the founders of modern revolutionary democratic
                socialism."
